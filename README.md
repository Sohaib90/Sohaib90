🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at Accenture building software solutions for Autonomous vehicles. 

🌱 I’m currently learning 3D graphics programming, Maya Python API, and Animation Programming.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate with Technical Artists in the game/film industry so I can build up my portfolio.

🤔 I’m looking for help with changing my career field from being a software engineer to a technical artist.

📫 How to reach me: sohaib.arshid101@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I love animated movies which has finally pushed me to learn about film and animation.
